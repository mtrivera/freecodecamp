## Description

The weather is displayed based on your location. You can toggle between imperial and metric units by clicking a button.

## User Stories

* I can see the weather in my current location.
* I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
* I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Problems

1. Getting user location information

## Solutions

1. Used third party API for location information, but only needed Geolocation API, which is built into most browsers 

## Things I Learned (TIL)

* jQuery
  * Practice more AJAX requests
* Geolocation API
  * Get a user's location info (latitude and longitude)

## Technology

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Geolocation API
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* CodePen
* VSCode

## Known Issues

* First Celsius conversion requires two clicks

## TODO

* Add CSS styling
* Make responsive
* Utilize Bootstrap
