### Miguel T Rivera

`Screenshot goes here`

## Description

## User Stories

* I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
* I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

## Problems

1. The `marked` library uses the `require` keyword which is not natively supported in browsers. 

## Solutions

1. Use a module bundler or a build tool to add support. I've decided on [brunch](http://brunch.io/).

## Things I Learned (TIL)
